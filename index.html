    <p>Puerto Rico[b] (Spanish for 'Rich Port'; abbreviated PR; Taino: Boriken, Borinquen),[10] officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico[a] (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. 'Free Associated State of Puerto Rico')[c] is a Caribbean island and unincorporated territory of the United States. It is located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida.

      The Commonwealth is an archipelago among the Greater Antilles located between the Dominican Republic and the U.S. Virgin Islands; it includes the eponymous main island and several smaller islands, such as Mona, Culebra, and Vieques. It has roughly 3.2 million residents, and its capital and most populous city is San Juan.[10] Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government,[11] though Spanish predominates.[12]
      
      Originally populated by the indigenous Taíno people, Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493.[10] It was contested by other European powers, but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries. Spanish rule led to the displacement and assimilation of the native population, the forced migration of African slaves, and settlement primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia. Within the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain.[13][14] By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered around a fusion of indigenous, African, and European elements.[15][16] In 1898, following the Spanish–American War, the United States acquired Puerto Rico.[10][17]
      
      Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917, and can move freely between the island and the mainland.[18] However, as residents of an unincorporated territory, American citizens of Puerto Rico are disenfranchised at the national level, do not vote for the president or vice president,[19] and generally do not pay federal income tax.[20][21][Note 1] However, in addition to the other four territories which send non-voting representatives to Congress, they do participate in presidential primaries. As it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the U.S. Congress, which governs it under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. Puerto Rico is represented federally solely by one non-voting member of the House called a Resident Commissioner. The U.S. Congress approved a local constitution in 1952, allowing U.S. citizens residing on the Island to elect a governor. Puerto Rico's current and future political status has consistently been a matter of significant debate.[22][23]
      
      Beginning in the mid-20th century, the U.S. government, together with the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company, launched a series of economic projects to develop Puerto Rico into an industrial high-income economy. It is classified by the International Monetary Fund as a developed jurisdiction with an advanced, high-income economy;[24] it ranks 40th on the Human Development Index. The main drivers of Puerto Rico's economy are manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and electronics) followed by the service industry (namely tourism and hospitality).[25]</p>

         <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim
            to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph
            World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require
          the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking”
           together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block. In 2015, they established the LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre in order to
              research other options for its product and packaging. “There is no common definition of a sustainable material. Several factors influence
                 the environmental sustainability of a material – the composition of the material, how it is sourced and what happens when the product
                  reaches the end of its life. When we search for new materials all of these factors must be considered,” said Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, CEO and
                   President of the LEGO Group. One material that has been floated as a possible alternative has been hemp. 420 Magazine motivated in their 
                   article that hemp could be a good.
